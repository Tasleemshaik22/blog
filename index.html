        <h2>What is Mental Peace?</h2>
        <p>“You should feel beautiful and you should feel safe, what you surround yourself with should bring you peace
            of mind and peace of spirit”
            <br> Mental peace refers to the deliberate state of spiritual calm and the potential of stressors such as
            the burden arising from pretending to perform at an optional level with a positive mind (inner peace).<br>
            Peace of mind is generally associated with joy, happiness, calmness, prayer, yoga, meditation etc. many
            spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. <br> we all know that inner
            peace is important to mental health. The human beings who are mentally strong are confident that they can
            handle whatever life throws their way.
            <br> The people you surround yourself with affect the way you think, feel and behave. Mentally strong people
            don’t waste their time or energy trying to change toxic people. They established healthy emotional and
            physical boundaries.
